# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Bucket Manager BFF project.

ADRs are short, text-based documents that capture important architectural decisions. Each ADR describes a design choice, its context, and its consequences. They are intended to provide a clear historical record of the project's evolution, making it easier for new team members to understand the design rationale and for all members to maintain consistency.

For a new ADR, please use the [template](0000-template.md).
