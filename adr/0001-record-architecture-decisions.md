# 0001. Record Architecture Decisions

- **Date**: 2025-06-20
- **Status**: Accepted

## Context

As the project evolves, we will make many architectural decisions. These decisions include choices about technology, patterns, and processes. Without a clear record, the rationale behind these decisions can be lost over time. This makes it difficult for new developers to get up to speed, for current developers to remember why a certain path was taken, and for the team to maintain a consistent architectural vision. We need a lightweight way to document these decisions.

## Decision

We will use **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**, as described by Michael Nygard.

ADRs will be stored as Markdown files in the `/adr` directory of the project repository.

Each ADR will have a unique, sequential number and a descriptive title (e.g., `0001-record-architecture-decisions.md`).

We will use the provided `0000-template.md` to create new ADRs, which includes sections for:
- **Status**: The current state of the decision (e.g., Proposed, Accepted).
- **Context**: The problem and constraints.
- **Decision**: The choice that was made.
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes of the decision.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Provides a clear and persistent record of architectural decisions.
- Helps new team members understand the project's history and design rationale.
- Facilitates communication and alignment within the team.
- The process is lightweight and developer-friendly, as it lives with the code.

### Negative:
- Requires discipline from the team to consistently create and maintain ADRs.
- There is a risk of ADRs becoming outdated if not actively managed.
